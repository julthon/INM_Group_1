                <h1>What is Javascript used for?</h1>
                <p>JavaScript is mostly used for programming inside of web-pages. As such, it is executed inside a users web browser to modify the static HTML and CSS and bring more dynamic functionality to the world wide web. This can be done in a variety of forms. For instance, if a website would like to offer spell checking to their users, JavaScript would be used to react to changes of the written text, check for mistakes and then modify the HTML of the page in a way that lets the user know about his typo.</p>
                <p>Apart from websites, JavaScript has many other applications. It can be used as a server-side language with popular runtimes like Node.js. But even apart from the internet JavaScript is used, for instance in PDF documents to automate scriped behaviour in forms and other interactive elements. JavaScript is even used as a scripting language for game engines like the unity engine.</p>
