                <h1>What is Javascript?</h1>
                <p>JavaScript is a programming language that has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. Originally it was developed in 1995 in order to have an easy way to dynamically modify HTML pages directly in the browser. It has various features of modern scripting languages, such as object oriented, imperative and functional programming capabilities. As it is a typical scripting language, it is interpreded (mostly by a browser displaying a web page) and not compiled before execution.</p>
                <p>All modern web browsers can execute JavaScript without the need for plugins. This is a significant difference to most other possibilities of making web pages interactive, like Adobe Flash or Microsoft Silverlight, which both require plugins to function properly.</p>
                <p>JavaScript has a standardized API for working with strings, arrays, dates and other objects, but it lacks standardized support for networking and storage operations. For these functionality it relies on the environment in which it is executed.
